# 🤚 Real-Time Hand Detection with Python

A real-time hand detection project using Python, OpenCV and Google's MediaPipe. 

This project is created to experiment with various Python libraries for computer vision and real-time detection.

## 📦 Installation Steps

- Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.7–3.10, mediapipe does not support Python 3.11+)
- Run following commands in the terminal:
  - `py -3.10 -m venv venv`
  - `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Install mediapipe
  - `pip install mediapipe`
 
### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- If you still get an error `Import "mediapipe" could not be resolved` after following the above steps, ensure you are using the correct Python interpreter
  - Press Ctrl + Shift + P
  - Select `Python: Select Interpreter`
  - Choose the Python version from your venv

## ✏️ Plans / Ideas
- Create a rock-scissors-paper game with the real-time hand detection
- Draw with a finger, move the drawings by detecting the hand motions
- Convert writings into texts
